   Trying to Reduce Boilerplate Code by Flare
</div>

## Features

1. Flare reduces the boilerplate code.

2. Controlling the Flare with a manual way also makes the boilerplate code a lot to separate areas. (smart_flare_animation.dart) This could be solved by "smart_flare" Package.

3. SmartFlareActor Widget can replace the Widget which controls the Flare manually. This Widget takes ActiveArea to separate ares on the Flare automatically.

4. On the ActiveArea, debugArea option shows the range of the area on the separated Flare.
